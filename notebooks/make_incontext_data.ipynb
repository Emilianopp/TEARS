Contrarily, they don't prefer war, fantasy-based films with supernatural elements, films with heavy plots featuring societal issues, psychological twists, or those set in surrealistic settings.

Despite preferring action and adventure movies, they avoid films with certain thematic or stylistic elements.

They are likely drawn to films offering rich storytelling, with plot points that delve into character psyches, moral dilemmas, or intense interpersonal relationships. Conversely, the user seems to have a distaste for genres that are light-hearted or provide escapist entertainment, such as slapstick comedies or simplistic family-oriented movies. The user does not enjoy predictable plot points, such as clichéd romances or mundane, formulaic storylines. However, other users may find charm in the escapism offered by such films, relishing in the easy humor, feel-good resolution of conflicts, or straightforward tales of good triumphing over evil without the narrative complexity preferred by this user.\n",
