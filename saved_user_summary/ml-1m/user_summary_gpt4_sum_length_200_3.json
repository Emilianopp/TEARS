Story arcs that celebrate adventure and combine clever dialogue with fantastical elements are also appreciated.\n\nConversely, the user does not particularly enjoy standalone horror or thriller genres, especially those that are more classic or psychological in nature. Plot points focusing on suspense, tension, and horror without comedic relief are less appealing to the user.
